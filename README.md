##  Overview
This repository provides a **step-by-step, from-scratch explanation of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** and their modern variants.  
It is designed for learners who want to **deeply understand sequence modeling, time-series learning, and NLP tasks** without treating models as black boxes.

The notebooks progress from **basic RNN theory** to **advanced architectures and real-world applications**.

##  Topics Covered
- RNN fundamentals and internal architecture  
- Forward & backward pass (BPTT)  
- Vanishing gradient problem and solutions  
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)  
- Word embeddings & data preparation  
- Bidirectional & stacked RNNs  
- Seq2Seq models  
- End-to-end emotion recognition  
- Text generation (next-word prediction)  
- RNN vs modern architectures (Transformers)
